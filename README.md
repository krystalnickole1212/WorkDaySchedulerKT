# WorkDaySchedulerKT

##Decription:
The workday scheduler uses moment.js to show your workday from 9 am to 5 pm, hour by hour. Each hour is color coded by whether it is in the past, present, or future. 


###Updated and Accomplished

The workday scheduler allows users to enter events from their schedule into the slots and save them in local storage.
